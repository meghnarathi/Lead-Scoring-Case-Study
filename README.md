# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study


## Problem Statement:

An education company, named 'XEducation’, sells online courses to industry professionals who are interested in their courses - on any given day, many people land on their website and browse for courses.

The company wants us to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.

The company requires us to build a model wherein we need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.
The CEO, in particular, has given us a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.


## Objective:

The company wants us to identify the most potential and promising leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’, such that the lead conversion rate is good for the company and the leads that are most likely to convert turn into paying customers.


## Overall Approach:

1. Sourcing the datasets and understanding them via descriptive information of all columns
2. Performing data quality and missing value checks, along with missing value imputation as part of establishing data sanity
3. Deep-dive into data using varied univariate, bivariate, multivariate visualizations and extensive data cleaning, variable transformations and treating the outliers
4. Checking for data imbalance and correlations
5. Variables conversion into appropriate formats – readying the data for logistic model building via dummy variables’ creation, train-test data splitting and feature scaling
6. Model building (iteratively), finding optimal cut-off using ROC curve, testing model on test data and model evaluation
7. Generated the lead score variable with respective lead numbers where a high lead score indicated a hot lead


## Files Uploaded:

1. A well-commented Jupyter notebook with the logistic regression model, the conversion predictions and evaluation metrics
2. The word document filled with solutions to all the problems - assignment subjective questions
3. The overall approach of the analysis in a presentation (PPT):
    a. Problem statement  mentioned along with the analysis approach briefly 
    b. Results explained in business terms
    c. Visualisations and model summary included along with business recommendations
4. A brief summary report (in 500 words) explaining how I proceededed with the assignment and the learnings that I gathered
